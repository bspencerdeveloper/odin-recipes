    <h2>Description</h2>
    This maple glazed salmon is delicious and very easy to prepare. I love maple syrup in everything and decided to use it in the marinade. My husband totally loved it; he wasn't a salmon fan until now.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound salmon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic, garlic salt, and pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut salmon into 4 equal-sized fillets; place in a shallow glass baking dish and coat with maple syrup mixture. Cover the dish and marinate salmon in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, turning once halfway.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake salmon uncovered until flesh easily flakes with a fork, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
